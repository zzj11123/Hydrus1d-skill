# HYDRUS-1D Workflows

## Project Inspection

1. Inspect files with `mcp__hydrus1d.inspect_project`.
2. Read `SELECTOR.IN`.
3. Determine active modules:
   - `lWat = t`: water flow.
   - `lChem = t`: solute/salinity transport.
4. Extract units, material count, layer count, boundary conditions, time settings, and hydraulic parameters.
5. Read `PROFILE.DAT` for depth, nodes, observation nodes, initial pressure head/concentration, material and layer layout.
6. Read `ATMOSPH.IN` if atmospheric boundary conditions are active.

## Scenario Or Derived Project Creation

Use this workflow when creating a new HYDRUS-1D project, copying an existing project for a new scenario, or changing a copied project.

1. Copy the base project and keep the original unchanged.
2. Apply the requested scenario edits, such as profile depth, boundary conditions, hydraulic parameters, solute parameters, observation nodes, or time settings.
3. Update `DESCRIPT.TXT` and any available project title, heading, or description metadata in the copied project.
4. The description must explicitly state:
   - the new scenario purpose
   - the base project name
   - the main differences from the base project
   - which major parameters were intentionally retained
   - water and solute/salinity settings when relevant
5. Re-read the edited description and main input files before running.
6. In the final report, state both the project path and the updated description.

Do not leave descriptions that refer to the original project when the copied project has been changed.

## Running a Model

Use `mcp__hydrus1d.run_model` with `mode="auto"`.

After running, verify:

- `success` is true.
- output files were refreshed.
- `Run_Inf.out` final convergence is true.
- `Balance.out` final time matches the requested simulation end.
- water-balance error is small enough for the use case.

## Water Result Analysis

Report:

- final time and convergence
- max and final water-balance error
- storage change
- top and bottom flux
- whether the profile is still transient or has reached steady state
- whether the wetting front reached the bottom boundary

## Solute/Salinity Result Analysis

For `lChem = t`, report:

- `No.Solutes`
- available `solute*.out` files
- concentration peak and arrival time when extractable
- concentration change by depth and time
- breakthrough behavior at observation nodes
- whether solute movement is consistent with water movement
- likely adsorption, retardation, dispersion, or reaction effects

For multi-solute projects, analyze each solute separately and then summarize combined behavior.

## Data Suitability Assessment

Before calibration, confirm:

- observation file format is readable
- required fields can be mapped
- variable names can be mapped to HYDRUS outputs
- times overlap simulation period
- depths overlap the profile
- solute observations include `solute_id` or `species`
- units and conversion assumptions are explicit

## Semi-Automatic Calibration

Default order:

1. Calibrate water-flow parameters.
2. Calibrate solute/salinity transport parameters.

Do not perform parameter search without user-provided bounds.

Water parameters:

- `thr`
- `ths`
- `Alfa`
- `n`
- `Ks`
- `l`

Solute parameters:

- `DisperL.`
- `DifW`
- `Bulk.d.`
- adsorption or partition parameters
- reaction or decay parameters
- `SolTop`
- `tPulse`

For each trial:

- copy the project
- modify the copy
- run the model
- extract outputs
- score against observations
- record parameters, status, and metrics

## Report Template

Use this structure by default:

1. `结论`
2. `项目类型与输入设置`
3. `运行状态`
4. `水分结果`
5. `盐分/溶质结果` when applicable
6. `实测-模拟对比` when observations are provided
7. `率定建议` when calibration is requested
